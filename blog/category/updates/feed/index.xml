<p>The post <a href="/blog/thingsboard-3-7-release/">ThingsBoard 3.7 release: JDK 17, housekeeping, enhanced localization, widgets, and more</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog/">Thingsboard's blog</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce the release of ThingsBoard version 3.7! Highlights include the migration to JDK 17, enriched localization support, database structure optimizations, enhancements to existing widgets, and the addition of several new ones.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Performance and security</h4>



<p>We&#8217;ve worked on a bunch of behind-the-scenes improvements to make the software more efficient and secure. Here&#8217;s a look at what&#8217;s changed:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Migration to the Java 17 LTS release:</strong> We&#8217;ve upgraded from JDK 11 to JDK 17, bringing in new features and improvements that help the software run more efficiently and securely.</li>



<li><strong>Spring Framework Update:</strong> We&#8217;ve updated Spring from 5.3.26 to 6.1.8, providing improved performance, enhanced security, and compatibility with the latest Java 17 features.</li>



<li><strong>Docker Image Update:</strong> Our Docker images have been updated from bullseye-slim to bookworm-slim. This update includes bug fixes and new features, ensuring a smoother and more secure deployment environment. See PR <a href="https://github.com/thingsboard/docker/pull/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">#11</a> for more details.</li>



<li><strong>Housekeeping service:</strong> We&#8217;ve added a new service that takes care of long-running operations in the background. For example, it removes old alarms, attributes, and telemetry records for entities you delete from the platform. See PR <a href="https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/pull/10201" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">#10201</a> for more details. </li>



<li><strong>Database structure optimization:</strong> We have reduced the size of the table that stores attributes by ~30%. This optimization ensures the software runs more efficiently, even on devices with limited resources. See PR <a href="https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/pull/9850" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">#9850</a> for more details.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Charts Library Upgrade</h4>



<p>We are upgrading our widgets to utilize Apache ECharts, introducing new capabilities and features for improved data visualization. This upgrade applies specifically to the following widgets: State chart, Pie chart, Radar chart, Polar area, and Bars. All these widgets now include a basic configuration form for a more intuitive setup experience.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2400" height="1770" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4634" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1.webp 2400w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-300x221.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-1024x755.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-768x566.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-1536x1133.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-2048x1510.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-512x378.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-920x679.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-1600x1180.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/color-settings-1-1920x1416.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Enhanced&nbsp; Localization Support</h4>



<p>With the new update, adding localization is now easier through the Web UI instead of using plain JSON. The improved localization support feature enables you to search by languages and term keys, filter by unfilled, modified, or new keys, and track translation progress more effectively.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2400" height="2154" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4632" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3.webp 2400w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-300x269.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-1024x919.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-768x689.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-1536x1379.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-2048x1838.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-512x460.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-920x826.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-1600x1436.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/custom-translation-3-1920x1723.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /></figure>



<p>These enhancements allow you to manage translations more efficiently and ensure your products are accessible to a broader audience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">QR Code Authorization</h4>



<p>With the new QR code feature, authorization in the ThingsBoard mobile app has become significantly simpler. When you&#8217;re logged into the web version, you just need to scan the QR code on the homepage or dashboard using your mobile phone&#8217;s camera. If the mobile app is already installed, it will automatically log you in. If the app is not installed, you will be redirected to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store to download and install it. Additionally, the QR code can be placed as a widget on any dashboard for easy access.</p>



<p>The QR code widget is highly configurable and can point to your custom application built on top of the ThingsBoard mobile app.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/qr-code.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4637"/></figure>



<p>The QR code is a quick, simple, and convenient way to authorize in the <a href="https://thingsboard.io/products/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">ThingsBoard mobile app</a>. Try it today!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Status widget</h4>



<p>The Status Widget provides users with real-time updates on the status of their devices or systems. For example, you can easily set up a visual widget to track the status of various objects, such as doors, windows, or barriers. Additionally, the widget is fully customizable, allowing you to use alternative icons, backgrounds, and other appearance settings.</p>

<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Message publishing</strong>: Conveniently publish messages with the ability to customize various MQTT-related settings for tailored communication.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MQTT 5: Flow Control</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="858" data-id="4487" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4487" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-300x107.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1024x365.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-768x274.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1536x547.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-2048x729.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-512x182.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-920x328.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1600x570.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1920x684.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">This update contains the Flow Control feature, a crucial enhancement for managing the rate of message flow in MQTT communications. This feature is particularly important in scenarios where clients or brokers have limited processing capabilities or bandwidth.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> Flow Control in MQTT 5 is achieved through a key parameter: Receive Maximum. It dictates the maximum number of QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that the client or broker is willing to process concurrently. Receive Maximum is exchanged within the CONNECT and CONNACK packets. Its default value is 65,535 based on the MQTT specification.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> Flow Control is an essential mechanism for several reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Preventing overload:</strong> Without Flow Control, there&#8217;s a risk of overwhelming a client or broker with more messages than it can process. This can lead to system lags, or in worst-case scenarios, cause crashes or unresponsiveness, particularly in smaller, less powerful devices.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Ensuring reliable communication:</strong> By controlling the flow of messages, MQTT ensures that data transmission remains stable and reliable.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Optimizing resource use:</strong> Flow Control allows for the efficient use of system resources. It ensures that devices are not bogged down by unnecessary processing tasks, which is particularly important in systems with limited computational power.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case</strong>: It can be any scenario (e.g. a smart home system or a traffic management system) where devices are constrained by processing power and cannot handle transmitting or receiving large amounts of data efficiently.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">The MQTT 5 Request-Response pattern introduces a structured approach to communication, enabling devices to send requests and receive responses in a reliable and efficient manner.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> In the Request-Response pattern, a client sends a request message to a specific topic, typically indicating the action it wants to perform. This request includes essential parameters such as the Response Topic and Correlation Data. The recipient, which may be another client or application, processes the request and issues a corresponding response message directed to the specified Response Topic. This response provides the result or acknowledgment of the request. Utilizing Correlation Data, the original requester can precisely match the received response to its corresponding request, ensuring seamless bidirectional communication.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> The Request-Response pattern addresses the need for synchronous communication in IoT systems, where devices often require immediate feedback or confirmation for their actions. By establishing a structured request-response flow, MQTT 5 ensures a reliable and timely exchange of information between devices and applications.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case:</strong> Consider a home automation scenario where a user wants to remotely control their smart lights. The user sends a request message to the TBMQ, specifying the action to turn on the lights. The broker transmits the request to the receiver which executes the action and sends the response message back to the user, confirming that the lights have been successfully turned on. This bidirectional communication allows for seamless interaction between the user and the smart home system, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other notable enhancements</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In addition to the features highlighted earlier, this release includes several points that strengthen the system&#8217;s reliability and efficiency. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Significant enhancements have been made in backpressure management specifically for non-persistent subscribers. This improvement allows the system to handle data flow surges for these subscribers more efficiently by implementing rate limits. As a result, it ensures the system&#8217;s stability, maintaining consistent performance even under conditions of high demand.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The enhancement of the disconnect client command with Reason Codes marks a notable improvement, offering clearer insights into disconnection causes (e.g. &#8220;Session taken over&#8221;, &#8220;Administrative action&#8221;) and facilitating more targeted troubleshooting and analysis.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This version brings improvements in memory usage and overall performance. An important resolution of a direct memory leak issue leads to an optimized operational environment. This results in reduced latency and higher throughput, significantly boosting the system&#8217;s performance and robustness.</p><p>The post <a href="/blog/tbmq-1-3-0-release-websocket-client-advanced-mqtt-5-features-and-more/">TBMQ 1.3.0 release: WebSocket client, advanced MQTT 5 features, and more</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog/">Thingsboard's blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This case study highlights how innovative IoT solutions revolutionize beverage distribution, offering a roadmap for others in the industry.</p>



<p><strong>Client:</strong> <a href="https://superbockgroup.com/">Super Bock Group</a>, the largest Portuguese beverage company<br><strong>Main request:</strong> Monitoring the beer tank levels in restaurants, predictive maintenance, and anomalies detection.</p>



<p>Staying stocked is as crucial as the quality of the goods served. That&#8217;s where the Super Bock Group stepped up its game. Along with ThingsBoard, they started a tech journey to keep their golden brews flowing seamlessly in restaurants, ensuring every glass raised was a toast to efficiency and innovation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The challenge</h4>



<p>The journey of a single beer from the brewery to the bar is far more complex than one might imagine. For Super Bock Group, managing this journey meant overcoming a series of challenges that, if not addressed, could lead to inefficiencies, unnecessary costs, and, most critically, an interrupted supply of their beloved beverages.</p>



<p><strong>The mission was clear – streamline operations to keep costs down and glasses up</strong>.<br>Super Bock Group wanted a smart way to monitor beer levels in tanks across restaurants, predict refill times, and swiftly address any issues. They went even further, tracking their delivery trucks in real-time, keeping tabs on volumes, temperature, and journey details from start to finish.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution: Smart, Intuitive, and Always On</h4>



<p>At various points of sale, like restaurants, beer tanks equipped with controller sensors monitor the beer levels, ensuring that they never dip below the threshold. Should the beer level approach this critical point, the system is designed to trigger an alert, safeguarding against unexpected shortages. Additionally, these sensors keep an eye on the tank pressure, maintaining the perfect conditions for beer storage. The information gathered by these sensors is seamlessly transmitted to ThingsBoard through a Wi-Fi connection via the MQTT protocol, ensuring real-time data flow and responsiveness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="584" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-1024x584.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4454" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-1024x584.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-300x171.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-768x438.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-1536x876.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-2048x1168.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-512x292.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-920x525.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-1600x913.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1-1920x1095.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tracking-superbock-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MQTT 5: Flow Control</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="365" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1024x365.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4487" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1024x365.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-300x107.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-768x274.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1536x547.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-2048x729.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-512x182.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-920x328.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1600x570.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1-1920x684.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">This update contains the Flow Control feature, a crucial enhancement for managing the rate of message flow in MQTT communications. This feature is particularly important in scenarios where clients or brokers have limited processing capabilities or bandwidth.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> Flow Control in MQTT 5 is achieved through a key parameter: Receive Maximum. It dictates the maximum number of QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that the client or broker is willing to process concurrently. Receive Maximum is exchanged within the CONNECT and CONNACK packets. Its default value is 65,535 based on the MQTT specification.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> Flow Control is an essential mechanism for several reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Preventing overload:</strong> Without Flow Control, there&#8217;s a risk of overwhelming a client or broker with more messages than it can process. This can lead to system lags, or in worst-case scenarios, cause crashes or unresponsiveness, particularly in smaller, less powerful devices.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Ensuring reliable communication:</strong> By controlling the flow of messages, MQTT ensures that data transmission remains stable and reliable.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Optimizing resource use:</strong> Flow Control allows for the efficient use of system resources. It ensures that devices are not bogged down by unnecessary processing tasks, which is particularly important in systems with limited computational power.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case</strong>: It can be any scenario (e.g. a smart home system or a traffic management system) where devices are constrained by processing power and cannot handle transmitting or receiving large amounts of data efficiently.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MQTT 5: Request-Response pattern</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="428" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-1024x428.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4489" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-1024x428.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-300x126.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-768x321.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-1536x643.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-2048x857.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-512x214.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-920x385.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-1600x669.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2-1920x803.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tbmq-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The MQTT 5 Request-Response pattern introduces a structured approach to communication, enabling devices to send requests and receive responses in a reliable and efficient manner.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> In the Request-Response pattern, a client sends a request message to a specific topic, typically indicating the action it wants to perform. This request includes essential parameters such as the Response Topic and Correlation Data. The recipient, which may be another client or application, processes the request and issues a corresponding response message directed to the specified Response Topic. This response provides the result or acknowledgment of the request. Utilizing Correlation Data, the original requester can precisely match the received response to its corresponding request, ensuring seamless bidirectional communication.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> The Request-Response pattern addresses the need for synchronous communication in IoT systems, where devices often require immediate feedback or confirmation for their actions. By establishing a structured request-response flow, MQTT 5 ensures a reliable and timely exchange of information between devices and applications.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case:</strong> Consider a home automation scenario where a user wants to remotely control their smart lights. The user sends a request message to the TBMQ, specifying the action to turn on the lights. The broker transmits the request to the receiver which executes the action and sends the response message back to the user, confirming that the lights have been successfully turned on. This bidirectional communication allows for seamless interaction between the user and the smart home system, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other notable enhancements</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In addition to the features highlighted earlier, this release includes several points that strengthen the system&#8217;s reliability and efficiency. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Significant enhancements have been made in backpressure management specifically for non-persistent subscribers. This improvement allows the system to handle data flow surges for these subscribers more efficiently by implementing rate limits. As a result, it ensures the system&#8217;s stability, maintaining consistent performance even under conditions of high demand.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The enhancement of the disconnect client command with Reason Codes marks a notable improvement, offering clearer insights into disconnection causes (e.g. &#8220;Session taken over&#8221;, &#8220;Administrative action&#8221;) and facilitating more targeted troubleshooting and analysis.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This version brings improvements in memory usage and overall performance. An important resolution of a direct memory leak issue leads to an optimized operational environment. This results in reduced latency and higher throughput, significantly boosting the system&#8217;s performance and robustness.</p><p>The post <a href="/blog/tbmq-1-3-0-release-websocket-client-advanced-mqtt-5-features-and-more/">TBMQ 1.3.0 release: WebSocket client, advanced MQTT 5 features, and more</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog/">Thingsboard's blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Revolutionizing Retail Operations with IoT</h3>



<p>The Schwarz Group, known for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lidl</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaufland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaufland</a> supermarket brands, operates over 13,000 stores in 32 countries. Facing the challenge of managing diverse technical equipment across its vast network, <a href="https://it.schwarz/en" data-type="link" data-id="https://it.schwarz/en">Schwarz IT</a> turned to the proven capabilities of the ThingsBoard platform. This strategic choice has been transformative, standardizing technologies and use cases across all supermarkets and ensuring customized, secure access to data for each store.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technical Innovations and Operational Excellence</h3>



<p>At the heart of our partnership with the Schwarz Group is the innovative use of the ThingsBoard IoT platform, which excels in integrating a vast array of devices across the entire network of supermarkets.

Such versatility ensures that regardless of the specific technology used by each device, seamless integration, and data consolidation is achieved.</p>



<p>Each store enjoys secure access to its data, enhancing the operational efficiency and responsiveness of the retail environment. Moreover, the IoT portal acts as a crucial visualization layer, presenting all relevant data from the connected devices in an accessible format. This enables staff to quickly analyze and rectify faults, thereby minimizing impact and enhancing customer experience.</p>



<p>This approach not only connects over 500,000 individual devices across the Schwarz Group&#8217;s network, reducing operating costs significantly, but also provides the freedom to select the most suitable device providers and suppliers. The strategic use of the ThingsBoard platform accelerates the digitization process by streamlining the interaction between data consumers and devices, demonstrating the platform&#8217;s agility and future-proof design. It facilitates the rapid deployment of new use cases in a standardized way, simplifying maintenance throughout the lifecycle and significantly contributing to the digital transformation of the retail space.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re excited to introduce a suite of advanced visualization widgets powered by <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html">Apache ECharts</a> to enhance your data analysis and presentation capabilities. This includes the new <strong>Time Series </strong>chart that now may combine lines and bars on the same widget. We have also added two new <strong>Bar </strong>charts to display data via bars with or without labels. Our priority was not only to deliver powerful and pretty charts but also to simplify the widget configuration experience. We hope you enjoy new data visualization capabilities!

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New grouping intervals: Week (Sun-Sat), Week (Mon-Sun), Month, Quarter</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="1773" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1.webp" alt="Form with seven options which configure grouping intervals for dashboard time window " class="wp-image-3793" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1.webp 2406w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-300x221.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1024x755.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-768x566.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1536x1132.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-2048x1509.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-512x377.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-920x678.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1600x1179.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/New-types-of-the-grouping-intervals-1-1-1920x1415.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p>The update introduces new grouping intervals for dashboard <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> configurations: <strong>Week (Sun-Sat)</strong>, <strong>Week (Mon-Sun)</strong>, <strong>Month</strong>, and <strong>Quarter</strong>. The intervals adjust to the browser&#8217;s time zone by default, but there&#8217;s also the option to set a custom time zone for further customization. These additions allow for more flexible and granular data visualization and analysis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Button widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="263" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp" alt="Five blocks with icons and text" class="wp-image-3794" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp 802w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-300x98.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-768x252.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-512x168.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve improved our platform with the new button widgets: the <strong>Action Button</strong> <strong>widget </strong>for navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions; the <strong>Command Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for sending commands to devices, updating attributes, or appending time-series data; the <strong>Toggle Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for switching between two device states; the <strong>Power Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for toggling the device on and off. Each widget is designed to offer users more control and interactivity within the platform, improving the overall experience. Explore the full potential of the new button widgets in the dedicated <a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" data-type="link" data-id="/blog/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Control widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="305" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp" alt="Three blocks with toggle button and one with slider" class="wp-image-3795" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp 802w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-300x114.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-768x292.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-512x195.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re introducing Control widgets: the <strong>Slider Widget</strong> and the <strong>Toggle Button Widget</strong>. Both widgets have a simple configuration interface and allow users to trigger commands to devices, update attributes, or append time-series data for the target entity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Alarm comment support for edge instances</h2>



<p>This feature enables bidirectional synchronization of comments on alarms between edge and cloud instances. With this update, users can seamlessly add comments to alarms directly within the Edge environment, and these comments are synchronized with the ThingsBoard cloud instance in real time, ensuring consistency and transparency throughout the entire system. Additionally, comments added or modified in the cloud instance are automatically propagated to the Edge environment, ensuring that all operators have access to the latest information regardless of their location or the system they are using.</p>

<p>The post <a href="/blog/push-notifications-to-thingsboard-mobile-apps/">Push notifications to ThingsBoard mobile apps</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog/">Thingsboard's blog</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, you can receive instant alerts and updates directly on your smartphone, making it easier than ever to stay connected with your IoT devices. Whether you&#8217;re monitoring temperature changes, tracking device status, or just want to stay informed, our new push notifications ensure you&#8217;re always in the loop. Get ready to elevate your IoT experience with real-time alerts wherever you are.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Firebase setup</h4>



<p>To deliver notifications from ThingsBoard instances to mobile apps, we utilize <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firebase</a>. To set up push notifications, create a Firebase project and provide the necessary Firebase credentials to both the platform instance and the mobile application. For setup instructions, community edition users should follow this community edition <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>, while professional edition users can refer to the professional edition <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Use Notifications</h4>



<p>After setting up the platform and your app, you can start using the notification center to send out alerts. You can do this in two ways: manually or automatically with notification rules.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Sending Notifications Manually</h5>



<p>Open the &#8220;New notification&#8221; wizard by following this <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#send-notification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>. Specify target recipients and choose &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; as the method for sending your notification. Please note that the recipient must install and login to the mobile application before the notifications may be sent. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1920" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit rule settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3870" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-300x239.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1024x816.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-768x612.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1536x1224.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-2048x1632.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-512x408.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-920x733.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1600x1275.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1920x1530.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>In the next step, you&#8217;ll be able to personalize your notification. This includes choosing a subject, writing the message, and picking a custom icon to appear in the mobile app&#8217;s notification section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2070" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard new notification settings form with four fields" class="wp-image-3871" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1920x1650.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>Notifications can do more than just inform; they can also take users somewhere specific. There are two options for what happens when someone taps on a notification:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Open URL:</strong> This can be any link, inside or outside the app. For internal links, you can direct users to pages like home, alarms, devices, assets, or customers by using these shortcuts: <code>/home</code>,<code> /alarms</code>, <code>/devices</code>, <code>/assets</code>,<code> /customers</code>, <code>/auditLogs</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Open Dashboard:</strong> This option works just like it does for web notifications, taking the user directly to a specific dashboard.</li>

<p>If you don&#8217;t set up a tap action, tapping the notification will bring up the notifications page by default.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Notification Rules</h5>



<p>Notification rules are your go-to tool for automating alerts based on specific events, making it a breeze to keep everyone informed without manual intervention. A common scenario is sending out alerts for new alarms. These rules can handle everything from simple notifications to complex escalation chains and are highly customizable. Learn more about notification rules <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#alarm-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. See the default rule below. This rule sends information about new alarm to all tenant administrators:</p>

<p>Each rule is associated with a notification <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>, which defines the delivery method and appearance of notifications. To get started with push notifications for new alarms, modify the &#8220;New Alarm Notification&#8221; template to include the &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; delivery option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1977" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit notification template settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3874" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-300x246.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1024x840.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-768x630.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1536x1261.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-2048x1681.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-512x420.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-920x755.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1600x1313.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1920x1576.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>You can either reuse the message and subject from web notification or create your own. To make your notifications more engaging and relevant, use dynamic content like <code>alarmType</code> and <code>alarmOriginatorName</code>. A full list of available parameters can be found in the built-in documentation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2040" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit notification template settings form with four fields" class="wp-image-3875" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-300x254.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1024x867.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-768x650.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1536x1301.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-2048x1734.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-512x434.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-920x779.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1600x1355.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1920x1626.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>After setting up your notification templates, you&#8217;re all set to see them in action without the need for any extra setup. For instance, by using the already available <code>Air Quality Monitoring</code> solution template, you can immediately start receiving notifications triggered by the predefined alarms in this solution. This approach lets you quickly validate your notification settings and ensure everything works seamlessly right out of the gate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="880" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1024x880.webp" alt="Smartphone with thingsboard alarm notifications on the screen" class="wp-image-3876" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1920x1650.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Don&#8217;t stop at alarm notifications. It&#8217;s a good idea to enable mobile alerts for updates, comments, and assignments related to alarms. Explore all the types of notification <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">templates</a> available to fully leverage this feature.</p>



<p>For a seamless user experience, you can link notifications to specific mobile dashboards. When an alarm triggers a notification, tapping on it in the mobile app can directly open the relevant dashboard. This integration is set up in the device profile&#8217;s <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/device-profiles/#alarm-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alarm rules</a>.</p>



<p>Handling your notifications is intuitive:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mark as Read</strong>: Swipe right on a notification.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Take Action</strong>: Swipe left to acknowledge, clear, or delete it.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>Since launching, our time-series charts have grown a lot but have become harder to configure due to many new features. We decided to make them easier to use and added advanced data zoom capabilities by switching to <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://echarts.apache.org/">Apache ECharts</a>, a popular and powerful charting tool. Below, we&#8217;ll walk through the new widget setup and spotlight the latest enhancements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time series chart family</h4>



<p>Our new chart family includes four types. The main one, the <strong>time series</strong> chart, lets you show lines, bars, and points all at once. The others are <strong>line</strong>, <strong>bar</strong>, and <strong>point</strong> charts. We&#8217;ll focus on the basic configuration of the time series chart below. The other charts&#8217; configurations and features are very similar.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time window and data source</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#widget-time-window" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> and <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types">data source</a> configurations are similar to other time series widgets. Please note that you may display data from multiple entities using <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="412" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp" alt="Thingsboard time window and data source configurations" class="wp-image-3749" style="width:798px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-300x121.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-768x309.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1536x618.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-2048x824.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-512x206.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-920x370.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1600x644.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1920x772.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Y axes</h4>



<p>New charts differ from the old ones by offering direct control over the Y-axes setup, influencing how these axes are shown visually. Each chart comes with a <strong>default</strong> Y axis that is fixed and cannot be removed. Initially, any new series or threshold you add will appear on this default axis. However, you have the option to create additional axes and specify these for your new series or thresholds during their configuration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="404" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp" alt="Thingsboard Y-axes setup with default configuration" class="wp-image-3728" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-300x118.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-768x303.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1536x606.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-2048x808.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-512x202.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-920x363.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1600x632.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1920x758.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each axis include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Option to toggle the axis visibility. Even if hidden, it affects the chart if min or max values are set.</li>



<li>An optional label for the axis.</li>



<li>Choice of axis placement: left or right side of the chart.</li>



<li>Minimum and maximum values to set the chart&#8217;s visual range. Leaving these empty enables automatic adjustment based on data values.</li>



<li>Units for the values are displayed next to the axis.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Selection between line or bar for the axis representation.</li>



<li>Additional settings to adjust the appearance of axis ticks and lines.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Series</h4>



<p>The series table lets you set up which time series data keys to show. You can display each series as either a line or bars, and it needs to be linked to a specific Y-axis. When displaying data from several entities together, you can use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a> as the data source. To differentiate between data series from various entities, we recommend including <strong>${entityName} </strong>or <strong>${entityLabel}</strong> in the series label. These placeholders will automatically be replaced with the specific names or labels of the entities, making it easier to tell the series apart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="409" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp" alt="Thingsboard series table with default config" class="wp-image-3729" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-300x120.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-768x307.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1536x614.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-2048x819.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-512x205.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-920x368.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1600x640.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1920x768.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each series include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A label for the series. Supports <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> template parameters.</li>



<li>The display style: choose between a line or a bar.</li>



<li>The color for the line, bar, or points.</li>



<li>Units that are displayed next to the value in tooltips.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Additional settings for managing the series&#8217; appearance in the legend and other visual aspects.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thresholds</h4>



<p>Threshold settings have been incorporated into the basic widget configurations, maintaining their full functionality while simplifying the process. There are three ways to set thresholds:</p>



<ul>
<li>Using a constant value for simplicity.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from the entity specified in the data source.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from a different entity, such as an asset, customer, or tenant, offers flexibility in threshold configuration.</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data zoom</h4>



<p>A valuable new enhancement is the introduction of data zoom functionality. This feature enables you to zoom into specific data points or ranges directly within your browser, efficiently and without the need for additional data requests from the server.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="418" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp" alt="Long chart with three lines and data zoom option" class="wp-image-3824" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-300x123.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-768x314.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1536x627.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-2048x837.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-512x209.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-920x376.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1600x654.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1920x784.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tooltip improvement</h4>



<p>The tooltip configuration has been updated to offer more flexibility in formatting data and showing the data&#8217;s time interval. By default, the tooltip will show both the start and end times of the data aggregation period. You now have the option to customize the font and colors for both the actual values and the date labels, as well as the tooltip&#8217;s background, to suit your preferences.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other EChart-based widgets</h4>



<p>We have added a few more widgets with slightly different configurations.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Bar chart with labels</h5>



<p>The widget is crafted to compare aggregated data across various entities or multiple data keys. To differentiate between data from different entities, incorporate <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> into the series label.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1812" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels.webp" alt="Thingsboard bar chart with labels" class="wp-image-3734" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-300x226.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1024x770.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-768x578.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1536x1155.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-2048x1540.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-512x385.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-920x692.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1600x1203.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1920x1444.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Range chart</h4>



<p>The range chart is specifically created to display a single time-series value from one entity, such as a device or asset. A distinctive feature of this chart is the &#8220;Range Colors&#8221; option. This allows you to assign specific colors to different value ranges shown in the chart, enabling a visual representation that matches the value&#8217;s magnitude with color.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="770" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1024x770.webp" alt="Thingsboard range chart which is showing temperature on a time period " class="wp-image-3735" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1024x770.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-300x226.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-768x578.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1536x1155.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-2048x1540.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-512x385.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-920x692.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1600x1203.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1920x1444.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:16px">Ensuring reliable and consistent monitoring of temperature and humidity is crucial for the proper storage of temperature-sensitive medications and perishable food products. Our partner, <a href="https://www.vypin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vypin</a>, has successfully deployed WhereView, a solution powered by ThingsBoard, for a leading global pharmaceutical corporation. This IoT application has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p>



<div style="height:16px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="451" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp" alt="Working conditions on the left side and device on the right side" class="wp-image-3797" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp 803w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-768x431.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-512x288.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The challenge</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposes stringent guidelines on pharmaceutical manufacturers concerning storage conditions and the regulatory compliance of control systems. The client approached Vypin with a request to overhaul their existing system, which failed to meet FDA standards, leading to penalties and the potential for product or ingredient spoilage.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The client&#8217;s primary concerns revolved around data loss. The then-existing devices were prone to disconnections due to various issues, such as network or power failures, leading to lapses in telemetry transmission or recording. Furthermore, the system lacked a mechanism for notifying the client about these disruptions. Additionally, there was no provision for remote access to monitoring data.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="is-style-cs-about" style="font-size:16px">Round-the-clock rotation of operators to control the temperature and humidity in the warehouse indeed is not the best solution. Therefore, in the regular automatic reports related to the storage environment state there were gaps in the tables and graphs. The FDA fines for such violations.</p>
<cite>Customer officer says</cite></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The solution</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In response, Vypin proposed the Vypin-WhereView system, leveraging ThingsBoard&#8217;s capabilities. The solution involved establishing a wireless network, along with the installation of sensors and gateways.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Addressing the initial concern of data loss, the newly installed sensors were equipped with memory modules to store telemetry data locally. Thus, even in the event of a gateway disconnection, data integrity was maintained. Upon restoration of the gateway&#8217;s online status, it would retrieve and transmit the stored telemetry to WhereView.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="893" height="407" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923.webp" alt="Screen with opened dashboard and devices in front" class="wp-image-3800" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923.webp 893w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-300x137.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-768x350.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-512x233.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The WareView application, powered by ThingsBoard, resolved the outstanding concerns of reliable data processing and storage and enabled differentiated access levels. Designated personnel were granted comprehensive access, allowing them to monitor data from all warehouses at any time and location. In contrast, warehouse managers were provided with tailored access rights, enabling them to oversee only their specific warehouses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="460" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp" alt="Two windows with alarms information  and dashboard" class="wp-image-3799" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp 803w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-300x172.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-768x440.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-512x293.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Accessing the dashboard, which displays various graphs and tables, simply requires logging into the system from a web browser.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">A noteworthy feature is the customized notification system, established through ThingsBoard&#8217;s rule engine and device profiles. This system alerts the relevant individuals in case of deviations from preset conditions, such as temperature threshold breaches. This feature facilitates immediate response and the implementation of preventive measures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The outcome</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Prevention is universally acknowledged as more efficient, cost-effective, and less time-consuming than cure. With the newly installed warehouse monitoring system, the client now has the capability to proactively prevent issues before they arise, ensuring the safety and integrity of their sensitive products.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This case study exemplifies the power of IoT in enhancing regulatory compliance and operational efficiency in critical industries such as pharmaceuticals. The Vypin-WhereView solution, backed by ThingsBoard, demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative and reliable monitoring solutions.</p><p>The post <a href="/blog/warehouse-monitoring-with-thingsboard/">Warehouse monitoring with ThingsBoard</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog/">Thingsboard's blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:16px">Welcome to the latest update from the ThingsBoard team! Our ongoing mission to improve the platform&#8217;s functionality and user experience brings us to the introduction of four innovative IoT widgets: the &#8220;Action button,&#8221; &#8220;Command button,&#8221; &#8220;Toggle button,&#8221; and &#8220;Power button.&#8221; Designed with a focus on usability, these new buttons are tailored for the most common IoT use cases, offering users enhanced control and flexibility in managing their IoT devices and dashboards. Let&#8217;s dive into their capabilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Action button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">This button facilitates single-click navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions. You may choose one of the common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a> to be triggered when the user clicks the button. You may also choose whether the button is in default, activated, or disabled state. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="441" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp" alt="Tree buttons with different clicking states " class="wp-image-3716" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp 2406w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-300x55.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1024x188.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-768x141.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1536x282.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-2048x375.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-512x94.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-920x169.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1600x293.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1920x352.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">More importantly, the button may dynamically change its state based on the value of the attribute or time-series subscription. You may find an example of the button that changes its state when the user attribute is updated below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file">
<a id="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a" href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tb_dynamic_button_states.json">tb_dynamic_button_states</a><a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tb_dynamic_button_states.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download="" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a">tb_dynamic_button_states.json</a>
</div>



<p style="font-size:16px">The behavior configuration is available in the basic widget settings:</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">Although the button supports all common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a>, we will highlight only the most popular in this article. To demonstrate them, we have prepared the dashboard that you may <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#import-dashboard">import</a> to your platform instance.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">The dashboard has two states: &#8220;default&#8221; and &#8220;other&#8221;. The default state contains 5 showcase buttons. The &#8220;other&#8221; state contains a line chart widget with random data. Let&#8217;s review each button below:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open dialog</strong> button uses &#8220;Navigate to new dashboard state&#8221; with the &#8220;Open in separate dialog&#8221; display option. So, the user will see the line chart opened in a modal window.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open popup</strong> button is similar, but the &#8220;Open in popover&#8221; display option is used. You may also explore various options for the &#8220;Preferred popover placement&#8221; option. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Command button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Command button widget is designed to perform three key actions: sending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rpc/">commands</a> to devices, updating <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/attributes/">attributes</a>, or appending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/telemetry/">time-series</a> data. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can specify a single device to carry out your chosen action, such as receiving a command. For those familiar with the platform, there&#8217;s an option to use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/">entity aliases</a> for targeting. This means you&#8217;re not limited to devices; you can target assets, users, or other entities capable of supporting attribute updates or time-series data additions. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Behavior settings enable the definition of the on-click action and condition when the button is disabled. More importantly, the button may dynamically become enabled or disabled based on attribute or time-series subscription. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Execute RPC action</strong> allows you to send the command to the device. You may configure the command (method) name and parameters of the command. The parameter value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. You may send the command without parameters by choosing the &#8220;None&#8221; option.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">By default, we use an un-persisted command with 5 seconds timeout. You may change the command parameters in the advanced settings of the action.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Set attribute action</strong> allows you to set or update the value of the particular entity attribute. The action configuration form allows you to configure the scope, key, and value of the attribute. The attribute value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. Please note that only devices support &#8220;shared&#8221; attribute scope. You must choose the &#8220;server&#8221; scope for all other entities. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Add time-series action</strong> allows you to add the new time-series value for the particular entity.

<p style="font-size:16px">You may dynamically disable the button based on certain values of the attribute or time-series key. For example, the dashboard attached below contains two buttons that switch the state of the user&#8217;s attribute &#8220;state&#8221;. When the user presses button A, it becomes disabled, and vice versa.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">You may find the sample dashboard JSON below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae" href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/command_buttons.json">command_buttons</a><a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/command_buttons.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae">Download</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">Alternatively, you may disable the button that sends the command to the device, if the device is offline. For this purpose, you may just use the value of the &#8220;active&#8221; attribute or time-series key. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The appearance settings for the Command button are identical to those of the Action button. The primary applications of the Command button are straightforward, focusing on managing devices and assets. This involves either issuing commands or updating attributes to control their operation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Toggle button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Toggle button widget shares many similarities with the Command button widget, but with a crucial distinction: it features two distinct states, &#8220;checked&#8221; and &#8220;unchecked&#8221;. This design allows it to perform two specific actions, &#8220;Check&#8221; and &#8220;Uncheck&#8221;, depending on its state. Users have the flexibility to fully customize the appearance of the button for both states, enhancing its visual and functional integration into their dashboards.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction&nbsp;</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Equipment in production plays an important role in achieving maximum efficiency, quality, and payback. The issues that are key to optimizing the use of equipment are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Underutilization of Equipment</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Ineffective Production Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Operational Bottlenecks</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Misaligned Capacity Planning</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solving these problems requires constant monitoring of equipment utilization and performance metrics. As production output increases, manufacturers may need to partially or completely change their equipment maintenance strategies and schedules to maintain efficiency. Unfortunately, these problems cannot be solved once and for all. But it also means that we can endlessly improve the optimization process.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why having the most up-to-date data is important when choosing an optimization strategy. Previously, with the help of logging, you could see how the equipment worked at the end of the day or week. With the growth of technology and the help of IoT devices, we can receive raw data in real-time. With advanced analytics, you can turn raw data into meaningful reports and predict future equipment behavior using machine learning models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment Utilization</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">To understand the overall condition of the equipment, you need to operate with a significant number of KPIs. We have divided KPIs by the problems they solve:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Underutilization of Equipment and Operational Bottlenecks</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Production Output &#8211; A numerical or quality indicator of the useful action performed by the equipment. The information is collected using counters, scales, or quality sensors transmitted via the network to the ThingsBoard. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>
</ul>

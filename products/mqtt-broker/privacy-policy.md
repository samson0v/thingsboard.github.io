<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<br>
<h2> Privacy Policy Statement on the Use of this Service (Website)</h2>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: grey">As of February 4, 2026</p>

<br>

<p> <b>1. Introduction</b> </p>
<p> 1.1 This Privacy Policy describes how we handle data generated by clients or users connecting to our free cloud MQTT broker (the <b>"Service"</b>), which utilizes the ThingsBoard MQTT Broker (TBMQ) technology. Due to the open and testing-oriented nature of this Service, user privacy expectations should be limited.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>2. Data We Collect</b> </p>
<p> 2.1 To facilitate MQTT messaging functionality, the Service automatically collects and processes without limitation the following technical data when you connect:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <b>Connection Metadata:</b> IP address, Client ID, Protocol Version (e.g., MQTT 3.1.1, 5.0), Keep-Alive settings, and Clean Session flags.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <b>Message Content:</b> Topic names and Message Payloads (the actual data body) sent to the broker.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <b>Authentication Data:</b> If you choose to provide a username or password (even if not required), this string is transmitted to our server.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <b>Session Data:</b> If you connect with Clean Session = false, the Service stores your subscription preferences and undelivered messages to support persistent sessions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <b>Personal data:</b> Your username (nickname), password or other data you upload via the user interface or in another way to the Service.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>3. Public Nature of Data</b> </p>
<p> 3.1 <b>IMPORTANT: This is a public test instance.</b></p>

<p> 3.2 Unless you implement payload encryption at the application level (before sending), assume that any user connected to this broker can subscribe to your topics (including via wildcard #) and view your messages.</p>

<p> 3.3 You strictly agree not to publish Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, passwords, or critical infrastructure secrets to this broker.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>4. How We Use Your Data</b> </p>
<p> 4.1 We use the collected data solely for the operation of the Service and its improvements:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <b>Message Routing:</b> Processing topics and payloads to deliver messages to subscribed clients.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <b>Service Stability:</b> Analyzing connection logs (IPs and Client IDs) to detect abuse, unauthorized stress testing, or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <b>Debugging:</b> Temporary retention of logs to troubleshoot TBMQ performance issues.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <b>User experience improvements:</b> By analyzing your behaviour, we can adjust the Service user interface to be more comfortable and easier to use.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>5. Data Retention</b> </p>
<p> 5.1 Standard MQTT messages are processed in a queue and discarded immediately after delivery to active subscribers.</p>

<p> 5.2 If you send a message with the Retained flag set to true, the Service stores this payload in our database. It remains there until overwritten by a new retained message or until the Service performs a system-wide reset/wipe.</p>

<p> 5.3 Connection logs and system metrics are retained for a limited period (typically less than 30 days) for security and maintenance analysis, after which they are deleted.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>6. Data Security</b> </p>
<p> 6.1 While TBMQ includes robust security features, this specific Service is configured as a public sandbox. We generally do not enforce encryption between your client and the broker unless you specifically connect via a designated SSL/TLS port.</p>

<p> 6.2 We cannot guarantee the security of data stored in persistent sessions or retained topics against malicious actors or system breaches.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>7. Third-Party Sharing</b> </p>
<p> 7.1 By no means, we sell your data. Data is not shared with third parties, except the Cloud infrastructure providers who host the physical servers/containers.</p>

<p> 7.2 If compelled by law enforcement or legal process, we can share your data.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>8. Changes to this Policy</b> </p>
<p> 8.1 We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of the Service after changes implies consent to the updated terms.</p>

<br>
<p> <b>9. Contact</b> </p>
<p> 9.1 If you have questions about how TBMQ processes your data in this instance, please contact: <a href="mailto:info@thingsboard.io">info@thingsboard.io</a>.</p>

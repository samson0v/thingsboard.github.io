### Upgrading Trendz Analytics to 1.14.0

{% capture upgrade_version_by_version%}
**NOTE**:
<br>
After upgrading it is required to update Trendz widget bundle in ThingsBoard. You can find detailed instructions how to do that via Trendz UI in [Trendz Widget Bundle upgrade](/docs/trendz/post-installation-steps/#trendz-widget-bundle) article.
<br>
You can upgrade Trendz Analytics from any version to the 1.14.0.

{% include templates/info-banner.md content=upgrade_version_by_version %}

#### Trendz Analytics image download

Download Trendz Analytics Docker image:

```bash
docker pull thingsboard/trendz:1.14.0
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Trendz Analytics service upgrade

* Create a dump of your database:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres sh -c "pg_dump -U postgres trendz > /var/lib/postgresql/data/trendz_dump"
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture dockerComposeStandalone %}
If you still rely on Docker Compose as docker-compose (with a hyphen) execute next command:
<br>**docker-compose exec postgres sh -c "pg_dump -U postgres trendz > /var/lib/postgresql/data/trendz_dump"**
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=dockerComposeStandalone %}

* Stop Trendz Analytics `trendz` container if it is running.

```bash
docker compose stop trendz
```
{: .copy-code}

* Set upgradeversion variable to your **previous** Trendz Analytics version (if you`re upgrading from 1.13.2 set upgradeversion to 1.13.2).

```bash
docker compose exec trendz sh -c "echo '1.13.2' > /data/.upgradeversion" 
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture dockerComposeStandalone %}
If you still rely on Docker Compose as docker-compose (with a hyphen) execute next command:
<br>**docker-compose exec mytrendz sh -c "echo '1.13.2' > /data/.upgradeversion"**
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=dockerComposeStandalone %}

* Update `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
< . . . >
  trendz:
    image: "thingsboard/trendz:1.14.0"
  trendz-python-executor:
    image: "thingsboard/trendz-python-executor:1.14.0"  
< . . . >
```
{: .copy-code}

* Start Trendz Analytics:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
{: .copy-code}

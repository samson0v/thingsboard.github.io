### Upgrading Trendz Analytics to 1.15.0

{% capture difference %}
[**Prepare**](#prepare-for-upgrading-trendz-analytics) for upgrading Trendz Analytics.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

{% capture tb_haproxy_note %}
**Important note before upgrading to Trendz 1.15.0**

If you are using Trendz behind **HAProxy**, make sure that the paths **`/trendz/`** and **`/apiTrendz/`** are routed to the Trendz backend instead of **`/trendz`** and **`/apiTrendz`**. 

Additionally, we highly recommend adding Trendz to the **ThingsBoard HAProxy configuration** so that Trendz is accessible from the **same domain as ThingsBoard**.

#### Trendz Analytics package download

{% include resources.liquid version="1.15.0" kind="ubuntu-download" trendz="true" %}  

#### Trendz Analytics service upgrade

* Install latest Trendz Analytics service 

{% include resources.liquid version="1.15.0" kind="ubuntu-installation" trendz="true" %} 

**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your trendz configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.

Execute regular upgrade script:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/trendz/bin/install/upgrade.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service

```bash
sudo service trendz start
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Sync Trendz with ThingsBoard

After upgrade, it's necessary to sync Trendz with ThingsBoard. You can find out how to do it [here](/docs/trendz/install/ubuntu#step-6-sync-thingsboard-with-trendz).
